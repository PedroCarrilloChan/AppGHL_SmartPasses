# Flask Web Application

## Overview

This is a Flask web application built with a traditional MVC architecture. The application provides a foundational structure for web development with Flask, featuring a responsive frontend using Bootstrap, SQLAlchemy for database operations, and a modular design that supports easy scaling and feature additions. The app includes basic routing, template rendering, error handling, and is prepared for user authentication features.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

**Web Framework**: Built on Flask with a modular structure separating concerns into distinct files (app.py for configuration, routes.py for URL handling, models.py for data models).

**Database Layer**: Uses SQLAlchemy ORM with support for multiple database backends. Currently configured to use SQLite for development with environment-based configuration for production databases (PostgreSQL support included via psycopg2-binary). Features connection pooling and automatic table creation.

**Frontend Architecture**: Server-side rendered templates using Jinja2 templating engine. Responsive design implemented with Bootstrap 5 (dark theme variant from Replit CDN). Static assets organized in separate CSS and JavaScript files with Font Awesome icons integration.

**Authentication Ready**: Includes Flask-Login dependency and User model with UserMixin, prepared for implementing user authentication and session management. Password hashing field is properly sized for secure storage.

**Error Handling**: Custom error pages (404) with consistent styling and navigation. Database session rollback on internal errors to maintain data integrity.

**Routing Structure**: Centralized route registration system with dedicated health check endpoint for monitoring. Routes are organized by functionality with proper HTTP method handling.

**Development Features**: Debug logging enabled, proxy fix middleware for HTTPS URL generation, and environment-based configuration for easy deployment across different environments.

## External Dependencies

**Core Framework**: Flask web framework with SQLAlchemy for ORM functionality and Werkzeug for WSGI utilities.

**Frontend Libraries**: Bootstrap 5 CSS framework served from Replit CDN, Font Awesome 6.4.0 for iconography from CloudFlare CDN.

**Database Support**: PostgreSQL adapter (psycopg2-binary) for production database connectivity, with SQLite as fallback for development.

**Authentication**: Flask-Login for user session management and email-validator for input validation.

**Production Server**: Gunicorn WSGI server for production deployment.

**Environment Configuration**: Relies on environment variables for DATABASE_URL and SESSION_SECRET configuration, with sensible defaults for development.
